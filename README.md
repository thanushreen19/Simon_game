If you repeat the sequence correctly, the game will add one more light and sound to the sequence.

With each correct repetition, the sequence becomes longer and more complex.
Keep watching, remembering, and repeating the sequence.

5.Making a Mistake:

If you press the wrong button or fail to repeat the sequence, the game will signal an error.
The game will restart, and you can try again.
